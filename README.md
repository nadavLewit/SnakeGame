# SnakeGame
A one player dice game against the computer. The first to hit exactly 100 points wins. The player and computer take turns in rolling two dice. Some combinations of the dice give more or less points than just the sum of the two dice. If the combination is (1,1), 0 points would be earned for this turn. If one of the dice rolls 1, only 1 point would be added to the score. If a double that isn't (1,1) is rolled, the sum of the roll would be doubled.
